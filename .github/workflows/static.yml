# This file is a duplicate between "main" and "site branches", but I'm afraid of losing it if it's only on one branch.
# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy static content to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  # push:
  #   branches: ["site"]
  create:
    branches: ["site"]
    # This triggers the workflow when a branch is created. Otherwise temp "site" branch won't trigger.
    # The above line really doesn't do anything with my workflow.

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
