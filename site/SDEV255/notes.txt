Multiple student feedback that they don't understand what was applied coming out of the course.
Concepts are lost in complex labs.
Comments are not helpful.
LABS SHOULD BE SHORTER IN SCOPE w/ LITTLE EXTRA CODE TO DISTRACT
- Make sure to move any CSS to its own file.
Need to put learning objectives so that students know how to approach, e.g.:
- Use a PHP foreach loop to...
- Use a PHP if statement to conditionally show output...
- Use the $_GET superglobal array to ...
- etc.


Labs to simplify / remove / fix:
- Grocery

- Login lab
    - Way too much going on
    - remove config values for hardcoded user and pass
    - remove redirects
    - be ready to step through; write order of things in advance in lab description as objectives
    - move CSS to own file

END OF COURSE ANONYMOUS SURVEY:
- Make it required or nobody will do it.
- Rate each lab: I understood the concepts from this lab (not at all - very well)
- I believe that I would learn better if the labs were broken into smaller pieces
- On a scale from 1-10
    1 = labs are simple but are "toy problems"
    10 = labs are complex but demonstrate production level code
