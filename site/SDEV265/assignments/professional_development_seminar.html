    <h2 id="assignment-description">Assignment Description</h2>
    <p>
      In this assignment you will watch a recorded seminar on a topic related to
      software technologies. You will then refine your understanding of the
      seminar content by summarizing the most important points in a one page
      briefing, concise bullet points, and a single sentence summary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Topics may be advanced for a novice developer, but do your best to try to
      pick something accessible and interesting to you. The idea is to expose
      you to new ideas and resources in the field of software development.
    </p>
    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
    <h3 id="seminar">Seminar</h3>
    <p>
      Watch a recorded seminar on a topic related to software technologies. This
      seminar should be at least 20 minutes in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      A seminar is a presentation or lecture on a specific topic, given by an
      expert or group of experts in the field and directed at a live audience.
      This is different from a tutorial or a workshop, which are more guided and
      interactive. The seminar you pick should not be a personal presentation
      from an individual (e.g. an individual YouTube educator).
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find seminars on corporate websites or YouTube. It&#39;s often
      easiest to find a major conference or event and look for recordings of the
      keynote speech or breakout presentations. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://events.google.com/io/">Google I/O</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Build</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent</a></li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/events/on-demand-replays.html"
          >Oracle Events</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to explore on your own.</p>
    <h3 id="write-up">Write-up</h3>
    <p>Compose a document containing the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Title and date of the event.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Link that you used to access the event. Some events require email
          registration - if this is the case please provide the link to the
          original registration page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One page summary of the most important points of the seminar in your
          own words. Do not copy and paste from the seminar slides or other
          sources, and do not use direct quotes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>3-5 bullet points summarizing key points of the seminar.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One sentence summary of the seminar content. How would condense the
          &quot;big picture&quot; idea of the seminar into a single sentence?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please provide headings to separate the different sections of your
      document, as well as your name and the date.
