        This tomb holds Diophantus. Ah, what a marvel! And the tomb tells
        scientifically the measure of his life. God vouchsafed that he should be
        a boy for the sixth part of his life; when a twelfth was added, his
        cheeks acquired a beard; He kindled for him the light of marriage after
        a seventh, and in the fifth year after his marriage He granted him a
        son. Alas! Late-begotten and miserable child, when he had reached the
        measure of half his father&#39;s life, the chill grave took him. After
        consoling his grief by this science of numbers for four years, he
        reached the end of his life.

      <summary>How old was Diophantus when he died?</summary>
      <p>
        Suppose that Diophantus lived to be d years of age. He was a boy for d/6
        years; had to shave after d/12 more years; was married after a further
        d/7 years; had a son 5 years later; his son died d/2 years later; then
        Diophantus died 4 years later. So:
      </p>
      <p>d = d/6 + d/12 + d/7 + 5 + d/2 + 4 = 75d/84 + 9.</p>
      <p>Hence 9d/84 = 9 or d/84 = 1. So d = 84.</p>
      <p>Diophantus lived to the age of 84 years.</p>
