# Secure Information Systems

## New Challenges to Ensure Secure Information Systems

### Complexity of Systems

Increasing complexity offers new avenues for attack.

- Mobile Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Social Media
- IoT
- Big Data
- AI
- Blockchain

Each new device connected to the Internet is a potential entry point for an attacker.

### Bring Your Own Device

**Bring your own device (BYOD)** = employees use their own devices to access company data and applications.

Pros:
- Employee
    - More familiar with own device.
    - (Reportedly) more productive.
    - (Reportedly) more satisfied.
- Company
    - Can reduce need for IT support.
    - Can reduce need for training.
    - Can attract and retain talent due to flexibility of work environment.

Cons:
- Security risks
    - Employees may not keep their devices up to date.
    - Employees may not use strong passwords.
    - Employees may not use antivirus software.
    - Employees may not use a firewall.
    - Employees may not use encryption.
    - Employees may not use a VPN.
    - Employees may not use two-factor authentication.
    - Employees may not use a screen lock.
    - Employees may not use a password manager.
    - Employees may not use a privacy screen.
    - Employees may not use a privacy filter.


### Sophistication of Cybercrime

Sophistication and level or organization of cybercrime is increasing.
- Organized crime (large groups)
    - Dark web
    - Sell services/exploits to highest bidder

## Perpetrators of Cybercrime

| Perpetrator       | Description                                                                                                          |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Careless Insider  | Employee who accidentally exposes information.                                                                       |
| Malicious Insider | Employee who intentionally exposes information.                                                                      |
| Cybercriminal     | Individual who uses computers, networks, and the Internet to perpetrate crime.                                       |
| Hacktivist        | Individual who hacks computers or Web sites in an attempt to promote a political ideology.                           |
| Lone Wolf         | Individual who acts alone to perpetrate a malicious act.                                                             |
| Cyberterrorist    | Individual who uses computers and the Internet to cause harm to a civilian population to further a political agenda. |

### Negligence

Not all compromises of sensitive information come from bad actors.

### State Based Cyber Threats

- **Cyberwarfare** = state-sponsored attacks on information systems.
- **Cyberespionage** = state-sponsored attacks on information systems to steal information.

#### Case Study: Stuxnet

## Attack Types 

## Types of Cyberattacks

### Malware

Many forms:

- Block access to a system or data
- Install software that allows attacker to control the system
- Covertly steal and transmit information
- Renders system inoperable

#### Ransomware

Malware that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

- Ransoms pait in bitcoin.
- Very lucrative business for cybercriminals
- Can halt essential operations for organizations. B/c of this ransom is often paid.

##### High profile examples: 

[A timeline of the biggest ransomware attacks](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/a-timeline-of-the-biggest-ransomware-attacks/). 

A few of these:
- Colonial Pipeline (2021)
    - Oil flow shut off for 5 days
    - Caused a gas run
    - Caused power outages, including in healthcare facilities
    - Paid $4.4 million in ransom
- University of California at San Francisco (2020)
    - School of medicine hacked.
    - Paid $1.14 million in ransom

### Phishing

Fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.
- email
- text message
- phone call
- social media

### Man in the Middle Attack

Malicious actor inserts him/herself into a conversation between two parties, impersonates both parties and gains access to information that the two parties were trying to send to each other.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Cyberattack in which a large number of computers (or other devices) are used to flood a server with requests for information in order to overload the server and deny service to legitimate users.

- Server is so busy handling illigitimate requests that it can't handle legitimate requests.
- Utilizes **botnets**.
    - Network of computers that have been infected with malware that allows them to be controlled remotely.
    - "Zombie" computers.
    - Infected machines do nothing until botnet is activated.

#### Legitimate Uses of Bots

- Search engines
- Web site monitoring, archiving, mirroring, indexing, content filtering, and categorization
- Automated online assistants

### SQL Injection

Attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server to reveal information it normally would not

### Zero-day Exploit

Occurs on the same day a weakness is discovered in software. At that point, it's exploited before a fix becomes available from its creator.

## Consequences of a Cyberattack

- [Data Breach Statistics](https://www.varonis.com/blog/data-breach-statistics/)
    - Good all around.
- [List of Data Breaches and Cyber Attacks in 2023](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2023)
    - See "Top data breach stats..."

- Loss of revenue
- Loss of intellectual property
- Loss of productivity
- Loss of reputation / customer trust

## Preventing Cyberattacks

### Hashing and Encryption

Encryption used to protect data from viewers in storage or as it is transmitted.

Hashing used to verify integrity of data.

- [What is difference between Encryption and Hashing?](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/encryption-vs-hashing)
    - See “Hashing and Encryption Use Cases”

_Hashing demo_

```bash
## One letter off...
echo "This is unencrypted." > tmp1.txt
echo "this is unencrypted." > tmp2.txt
md5sum tmp1.txt
md5sum tmp2.txt
```

_Encryption demo_

```bash
## Encrypt then view file...
gpg -c tmp1.txt
rm tmp1.txt
## Then decrypt...
gpg -o tmp1.txt -d tmp1.txt.gpg
```

### User and Group Permissions

Used to control access to files and directories.

_Read only demo_

```bash
## Note the permissions on tmp1.txt
ls -l
## Set tmp1.txt to read only
chmod 444 tmp1.txt
ls -l
## Now we can't edit the file.
```

### Separation of Duties

Divide responsibilities for a system among multiple people / groups to:
- Prevent damage from ignorant users
- Limit damage from a single person

Example:
- Should the (Database Administrator) DBA be able to access/view user information?
- Should user be able to delete a database table?


### CIA Security Triad

- Confidentiality
    - Only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- Integrity
    - Data is accurate and complete.
    - Only authorized users can modify data.
- Availability
    - Data is accessible when needed.
    - "Uptime"
    - e.g., might aim for 99.999% availability.

### Cyber Threat Tracking

[Cybersecurity Alerts & Advisories CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories)

Case Study: drill into SEP 26, 2023 Industrial Control Systems Advisory
- Who is the target?
- What devices might be used for the attack?
- What type of attack is it?



# Legal, Ethical, and Social Issues

## Corporate Social Responsibility

### Code of Conduct 

Set of rules outlining norms, rules, and responsibilities and proper practices of a party or organization.

- [Google's Code of Conduct](https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html)
- [Microsoft's Code of Conduct](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/codeofconduct)
- [Apple's Code of Conduct](https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple_Code_of_Conduct.pdf)
- [Facebook's Code of Conduct](https://www.facebook.com/codeofconduct)
- [Amazon's Code of Conduct](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200109660)
- [Twitter's Code of Conduct](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules)
- [Uber's Code of Conduct](https://www.uber.com/legal/community-guidelines/us-en/)

### Practical Examples

- Interorganizational commitments
    - Employee diversity
    - Paternity/maternity leave
    - Diverse employee pool
- Philanthropy
    - Disaster relief
        - [How Amazon is assisting in Ukraine](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/community/amazons-assistance-in-ukraine)
        - [How Companies Are Responding to the Earthquake in Turkey and Syria](https://ccc.bc.edu/content/ccc/blog-home/2023/02/companies-respond-earthquake-turkey-syria.html)
    - 
- Human / environmental rights
    - Ethical sourcing
    - Labor standards
    - Environmental sustainability commitments
- Community engagement 
    - Community partnerships
        - E.g. what kinds of things to corporations do when they're starting up a new facility in a community?
    - Open source
    - Open education

        - Benefits of providing this?
- Consumer protection
    - Privacy
    - Product safety

### How can Corporate Responsibility Practices go Wrong?

#### Thorny areas

- **Greenwashing** = conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about how a company's products are more environmentally sound.
- **Pinkwashing** = conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about how a company is helping to support breast cancer awareness.
    - ...and other forms of **"causewashing"**.

#### Other Misleading Branding / Advertising Practices

Legal but considered (by most) unethical.

- Vague or nondescript language
    - E.g., "all natural"
- Playing on public hype slogans
    - e.g., "superfoods"
- Misleading statistics
    - Cherry picking; selecting data that supports your position while ignoring data that doesn't.
    - Misleading graphs; e.g., using a graph that doesn't start at zero.
    - Misleading averages; e.g., using mean instead of median.
- Hidden Trade-offs
    - E.g., promoting a product as energy-efficient but neglecting the fact that it uses harmful chemicals

### Respondeat Superior

**Respondeat Superior** = "That the master must answer" (Latin)

- Doctrine that holds an employer or principal legally responsible for the wrongful acts of an employee or agent, if such acts occur within the scope of the employment or agency.

- How is this relevant to our discussion?

## Data Collection and Privacy Concerns

[Internet Data Collection](images/internet_data_collection.png)

- Who should be responsible for setting the rules about what’s okay to collect, when, where, and how?

- If we’re not happy about how it’s currently being done, how can we change the existing policies?

### Government Data Collection

_FISA_
- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
- [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978](https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/house-bill/7308)
- Limited govt surveillance powers
- Established protections for US citizen - govt needs a warrant to collect data.

_Patriot Act_
- [USA PATRIOT Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3162)
- "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act"
- Greatly expanded govt surveillance powers
- Passed in response to 9/11
- Allowed govt to:
  - Get warrant to monitor electroic comms without probable cause
  - Collect business records without warrant
  - Detain foreign nationals without charging them with crime.
  - See the link for more...

_Freedom Act_
- [USA Freedom Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3361)
- Limited govt surveillance powers
- Ended the government's bulk collection of phone records
- Added more oversight and transparency of government surveillance programs.
- Expired March 15, 2020

## Rhetoric - Modes of Communication

**Side note:** I'm not a rhetorician, but I think it's important to understand the basics of rhetoric. This are simplifications.

#### Broadcast

- One (agent/agency) to many
- One way communication.
- Examples?

<div class="spoiler_outer" tabindex="0">
    <p>What is the goal</p>
    <p class="spoiler_placeholder"></p>
    <div class="spoiler_inner">
    <pre>
To influence.
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

#### Debate

- Two sides
- Binary positions and outcomes
- Examples?

<div class="spoiler_outer" tabindex="1">
    <p>What is the goal</p>
    <p class="spoiler_placeholder"></p>
    <div class="spoiler_inner">
    <pre>
Ideal: To influence.
In practice: To win.
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

#### Argument

- One to one
- Examples?
- How to avoid negative connotations?
    - Remove emotional attachment to outcomes.

<div class="spoiler_outer" tabindex="2">
    <p>What is the goal</p>
    <p class="spoiler_placeholder"></p>
    <div class="spoiler_inner">
    <pre>
To influence.
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

#### Dialogue / discussion

- One to one; One to many; Many to many...
- Examples?

<div class="spoiler_outer" tabindex="3">
    <p>What is the goal</p>
    <p class="spoiler_placeholder"></p>
    <div class="spoiler_inner">
    <pre>
To share.
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

A solid option?: 

_Argumentative dialogue_

- Exchange ideas.
