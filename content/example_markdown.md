<!-- This is called the "yaml frontmatter". Nothing can go before it. -->

<!-- base.html will add title from above as an h1 here.> -->

<!-- 
    Use img HTML tag instead of markdown. Markdown isn't flexible enough - need to be able to resize images quickly.
    Not sure why the transform is leaving original size bounding box, but can probably fix with CSS. 
-->

<!-- The wrapper span is needed to allow the image to be resized... who knows why. -->
<!-- use "fig" snippet -->

```

## This is an h2
