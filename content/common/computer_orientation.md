## Naming Files and Folders

Spaces in files and directories can be a cause of bugs, and generally make life more difficult for programmers. Instead:

**Good Habits:**

- Use underscores (`_`) or _CamelCase_ instead of spaces.

## File Extensions

The file extension allows a file to be associated with a specific program. For example:

- `.txt` is associated with a text editor.
- `.html` is associated with a web browser
- `.docx` is associated with Microsoft Word.

You can change the file extension to whatever you want (despite warnings you may receive).

<p class="demo">Demo</p>

- Create a new file called `test.txt`.
- Remove the extension.
- Open the file in a text editor.

**Good Habits:**

- Make sure file extensions are visible. Windows hides them by default.
- Be sure to check the file extension prior to saving.

## Directory Structure

- _Directory_ and _folder_ mean the same thing.
- Directories are containers for storing other files.
- They have a hierarchical structure, like a family tree.

<p class="demo">Demo:</p>

Use tree terminiology to draw and describe the following directory structure, from [Game of Life - React](https://github.com/mpjovanovich/life_react)

In particular:

- Root directory?
- Sibling directories?
- Child directories?
- Parent directories?
- Ancestor directories?
- Descendant directories?

**Good Habits:**

- Use a hierarchicial directory structure where possible.
- Use a consistent naming convention.
