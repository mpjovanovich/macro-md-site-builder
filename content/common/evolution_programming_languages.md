# Overview of Programming

## Evolution of Programming Languages

### First Generation

- Machine code
- What the processor understands
- At the start of computing “instructions” in binary were placed into registers (physically by flipping switches), then a program was run.

### Second Generation

- Assembly language
- A more human readable version of machine code
- Instructions now had commands to move data and control program flow
- Still used in very simple computers
- See: [x86 instruction listings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings)

### Third Generation

- Compiled or interpreted languages
- Humans can read it and quickly know what the program is doing.

## Compiled vs Interpreted

- A **compiler** is a program that translates code written in a high-level language to a lower level language.
- **Compiled languages** are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute.
- **Interpreted languages** are not compiled into machine code before they are run. Code is executed "as is" as each line is come across.

<p class="demo">Demo:</p>

- Compile a C program with gcc
- Run a Python program line by line

<p class="demo">Critical Thinking Exercise:</p>

**What do the above data tell us?.**

- Be mindful of timeliness.
- Be mindful of the source and methodology.
- In particular, look at RedMonkQ121 Programming Language Rankings.
