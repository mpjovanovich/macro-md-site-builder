# Git

![Git](https://git-scm.com/images/logo@2x.png)

Git is a powerful tool that you'll almost certainly come across in your career.

All of the topics below are tied directly or indirectly to Git.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a program that runs on a computer. It needs to be installed like any other program:

- [Git (installation and documentation)](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a **version control system (VCS)**:

- Stores files and their history
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Allow for point in time recovery and comparison
- Allows more than one person to work on (or examine) the same file at the same time.

## How to Interface with Git

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- Recommended for beginners
- GitHub via the browser
- VS Code Source Control Panel

## GitHub

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories.

GitHub is not the same as Git.

### Git Repositories

A **repository** is a collection of files and their history.

- Should be one repository per project.

- Roughly equivalent to a folder on your computer.

- A user can have many repositories:

![GitHub Repositories](images/github_repos.png)

Files can be uploaded to the repository via drag and drop, or the upload button:

![GitHub Upload](images/github_repos_2.png)

### GitHub Classroom Assignments

- Each assignment will have a link.
- When you click the link, it will create a repository for you.

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 2rem; color: #f00;">
ALL REPOSITORIES FROM THE COURSE WILL BE DELETED AFTER THE COURSE HAS ENDED!
</p>

If you with to save your work you must fork your existing repository to your personal GitHub account.

#### Finding Repos for the Course

- You'll be put in an **organization** for the course.
- Click profile icon in top right, then click **Your organizations**:

![GitHub Organizations](images/github_orgs.png)

- Click the organization for the course; it will have your repos.

## GitHub Codespaces

- **GitHub Codespaces** is a virtual development environment that runs in the browser.
- Run it by clicking the green button in the top right of the repository page:
- Allows you to run VS Code in the browser.
  - Uses https://vscode.dev/ - online IDE

### Creating a Codespace

- To create
  - Go to your repository
  - Click the "Code" button
  - Click the Codespaces tab

![GitHub CodeSpaces](images/github_codespaces_1.png)

### Closing a Codespace

GitHub gives you an allocated amount of minutes to use per month. While active, codespaces will use some of your minutes.

- To close while in the Codespace
  - Bring up the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`
  - Type `Codespaces: Close Current Codespace`
- To close from the repository page
  - Go to your repository
  - Click the "Code" button
  - Click the Codespaces tab
  - Delete any active codespaces
- To check if you have existing codespaces
  - Go to: https://github.com/codespaces
  - Delete any active codespaces

**As long as your code has been pushed to GitHub, it is safe (and encouraged) to close/delete a codespace whenever you're done with a work session.**

You can always start a new one.

### Checking Your Balance

- Go to https://github.com/settings/billing/summary
- Scroll down to Codespaces:

![GitHub Billing](images/github_codespaces_billing.png)

- Note that hours listed are **core hours**.
- We use 2 core machines, so 1 hour of Codespaces usage is 2 hours of core hours.
- You should have 90 hours of Codespaces usage per month.

## VS Code

### VS Code Terminal

#### Terminals and Shells

Git commands are in the form `git [your_command_here] --[optional_flags_here]`.

Git commands are typed into a **terminal** which runs a **shell**.

- A **terminal** provides a user interface into a shell.

  - This is what you type commands into.
  - Like the part of the car that you see and interact with.

- A **shell** is a program that executes text **commands**.

  - This is what actually runs the command.
  - Like the "engine" of a car.
  - Usually use `bash` or `zsh` shells.

The CLI for Git can be accessed in a VS Code terminal:

- `Ctrl + ~` or `View > Terminal`.

Make sure that you are in the root directory of your project:

- Use the `pwd` command to see the current directory.

Make sure that you have the correct shell selected, _bash_ or _zsh_:

### VS Code Source Control Panel

The GUI for Git can be accessed in the VS Code Source Control Panel:

![VS Code Source Control](images/vscode_source_control_1.png)

- The number in the circle indicates the number of files that have been changed.
- A commit message is required before you press the button.

After committing, you can push to GitHub with the Sync button:

## Instructor Feedback for Assignments

### Grading Results

- After grading, your instructor will leave feedback on your assignment in GitHub.
- You may access this feedback via the GitHub website.
- Check the **Pull requests** tab:

![GitHub Pull Requests](images/github_feedback_1.png)

- You will se general comments, and line-by-line comments.
- Comments can also be viewed in a Codespace.

![GitHub feedback](images/github_feedback_3.png)

### Asking for Help

If requesting help via email, it will help your instructor if you leave inline comments. You may do this by opening a Codespace and clicking the message icon to the left of the line number that you'd like to comment on:
