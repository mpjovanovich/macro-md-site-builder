## Agenda

- Lecture
- Lab

# Planning a Website

Plan first, build second!

## Rhetoric

### Purpose

What is this website meant to do?

- Inform
- Persuade
- Entertain
- Art
- Sell
- ...

Usually best not to mix and match.

### Audience

Who is going to be using this website?

<p class="demo">Case Study:</p>

**Consumer Cellular**

[https://www.consumercellular.com/](https://www.consumercellular.com/)

Who are we targeting?

- Big font
- Old guy in suit
- Site design reminiscent of 90’s AOL era
- Pixelated favicon
- AARP ads
- inconsistent color palettes

<p class="demo">Case Study:</p>

**T-Mobile**

[https://www.t-mobile.com/](https://www.t-mobile.com/)

Who are we targeting?

- Pink
- “Flat” design follows current trends
- Use of modern javascript libraries for site functionality (menus, galleries, etc.)

## Early Iterations

- Help to organize thoughts.
- Can serve as deliverables to clients for feedback.
- Can prevent costly changes late in development.

### Wireframes

Rough sketches of the layout of a page.

- Can be done with pen and paper, or with software.
- Show layout, placement of elements, etc.
- Rough sketch for the developer.

Some online tools:

- [https://wireframe.cc/](https://wireframe.cc/)
- [https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/)
- [https://www.mockflow.com/](https://www.mockflow.com/)

<p class="demo">Demo:</p>

To start: I recommend [https://wireframe.cc/](https://wireframe.cc/) b/c of freeness and simplicity.

### Mockups

More detailed representations of the final product.

- Can be done with combination of Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.
- Show color schemes, fonts, etc.
- Client feedback.

_Lorem Ipsum_ is a placeholder text used to fill space in a mockup.

_Examples_

<figure>
    <span>

    </span>
</figure>

### Prototypes

Incorporate interactivity into mockups / wireframes.

Nowadays, often as easy as making several mockups; especially w/ modern JS and CSS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, React, etc.)

- Usability testing
- User feedback

# Elements of an Effective Website

## Organization

### Hierarchical

- Most common
- Tree structure

_Examples:_

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia)

### Sequential

- Linear
- Like a book
- Good for tutorials, wizards, etc.

_Examples:_

- [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

### Single Page Applications

- All content on one page
- Good for mobile devices
- Stress on the _application_ part: Not beginner friendly

_Examples:_

- [https://www.airbnb.com/](https://www.airbnb.com/)
- [https://www.netflix.com/](https://www.netflix.com/)

## Visual Design

**UI = User Interface**

**UX = User Experience**

- UI = how it looks
- UX = how it works

Does my design...

- Form a consistent theme?
- Aid in navigation?
- Aid utility/function of site?
- Identify relative importance of elements?

### Types of Pages

#### Landing Pages

- Nontraditional structure is okay.

#### Content Pages

- Consider using classic F or Z patterns.
- [Visual Hierarchy, Gutenberg Diagram, F & Z Pattern](https://lineindesign.medium.com/be-a-designer-who-can-also-help-with-writing-copy-2f4ea02a5646)

### Color

#### Color Theory and Palette Selection

- Image or logo can be starter for color palette.
- Color wheel can be helpful.
  - [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/)
  - [https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)

#### CSS Color

- Colors are typically defined by name or HEX code:

  - [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp)
  - [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)

- HEX code represents a color in RGB (red, green, blue) format: **#RRGGBB**
  - Each pair of characters represents a value from 00 to FF (0 to 255 in decimal).
  - 0 = no color
  - FF = full color

## Usability Principles for Web

### Least Cognitive Load

- Minimize the amount of thinking the user has to do.
- E.g.: Better to use recognized icon than something too clever.
  - [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)

### Responsive Design / Mobile First

- Design for mobile first, then scale up.
- Use media queries to adjust layout for different screen sizes.
- Use min/max-width to set breakpoints for layout.
- More to come...

## Accessibility

More to come... for now:

- Use semantic HTML
- Use alt text for images
- Use descriptive titles for pages
- Avoid low contrast foreground/background colors

# Snippet Testing

For quick one-off tests, use online code editors to test snippets:

# Intro to CSS

## Overview

**CSS = Cascading Style Sheets**

We use CSS to style HTML.

- CSS is a _cascading_ language.
  - Styles can be inherited from parent elements.
  - Styles can be overridden by child elements.

## Anatomy of a CSS Rule

<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/img_selector.gif" style="">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">W3 Schools: CSS Syntax</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

```css
/* Here's another example. */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

## Inline Styles

**Highest specificity**

Can apply a `style` attribute to any HTML element:

```html
<p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Multiple rules are separated by semicolons.

```html
<p style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## Internal Styles

**Medium specificity**

Can create a style block in the `<head>` of an HTML document:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

## External Styles

**Lowest specificity**

Can create a separate CSS file and link it to an HTML document:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
```

## HTML id and class Attributes

- id = unique identifier; use # prefix for CSS selector
- class = group identifier; use . prefix for CSS selector

```html
<h1 id="salads" class="foodMenu">Salads</h1>
<h1 id="sandwiches" class="foodMenu">Sandwiches</h1>
```

```css
.foodMenu {
  font-weight: regular;
}
#salads {
  color: green;
}
#sandwiches {
  color: brown;
}
```
