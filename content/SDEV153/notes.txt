FOR NEXT SEMESTER:

Break existing notes into topics, not weekly sections. Sometimes we have to "grab and go" with something.

Replace Mozilla docs with https://web.dev/learn  content 
  - These are much more like learning from a path
  - They have associated codepens

Use for into to demo decoupling of style from content.

TESTING

Selenium Python library. 
Maybe formatted code diffs for HTML and CSS.
Unit tests with assert for module concepts.
Publish "checker" tool via Google app - let students test against against image of solution.
I can probably just work on my solution during lab hours.

Maybe, but probably selenium can do this in a better way: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/difflib.html#difflib.HtmlDiff
