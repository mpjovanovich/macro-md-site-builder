- A URL is a **Uniform Resource Locator**.

## Protocol

- The protocol tells the browser how to communicate with the server.
- HTTP = **HyperText Transfer Protocol**
  - The protocol used to transfer web pages.
- HTTPS = **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure**
  - Uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection.

## Domain Name

- An **IP address** is a unique identifier for a computer on a network.
  - IP addresses are for computers and nerds.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** is a service that translates hostnames to IP addresses.
  - Domain names are for humans.
  - It's just a lookup table.

## Localhost

- **localhost** is a special hostname that refers to the local machine.
- We can ping the localhost to get the IP address.

```bash
$ ping localhost
```

## Port

- Ports are used to identify which program should receive the data.
- A program is said to be 'listening' on a port.

## Default ports:

If no port is specified, the browser will use the default port for the protocol.

| Protocol | Port |
| -------- | ---- |
| HTTP     | 80   |
| HTTPS    | 443  |
| MariaDB  | 3306 |

## Path

- The path is the location of the resource on the server.
- The **root** of our web server is the _htdocs_ folder.
- For this class:
  - **http://localhost:80/SDEV255/**
