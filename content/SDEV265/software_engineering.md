# Software Engineering

## Why is software engineering important?

- Economies of nations and global businesses are dependent on software.
- Emerging technologies are dependent on software.
- Software often represents the most valuable asset of a company.
- Propper engineering can:
  - Reduce costs
  - Reduce time to market
  - Reduce risk
  - Improve quality
  - Improve safety / security
  - Improve customer satisfaction
- Ultimately more optimal than not doing it, even if up front costs are higher. Consider inverse of above:
  - Increased costs
  - Increased time to market
  - Increased risk
  - Decreased quality
  - Decreased safety / security
  - Decreased customer satisfaction

## The Balancing Act

- Overengineering= bad
- Underengineering= bad
- Middle... engineering.. = good

## Attributes of Good Software

- Maintainable
  - Minimize effort to modify and fix
- Dependable / Reliable
  - Minimize frequency and severity of failures
- Efficient
  - Minimize use of resources
- Acceptable / Usable
  - Minimize deviation from requirements.
  - Minimize demands on users

## Fundamental Activities of Software Engineering

- Software specification
  - Customers and engineers define software constraints on its operation.
- Software development
  - Software is designed and programmed.
- Software validation
  - Software is checked to ensure that it meets requirements.
- Software evolution
  - Software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements

## Software Engineering vs Software Development

**Software Engineering** is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

**Software Development** is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

In practice: Software developers must participate in software engineering activties.

- More limited in scope
- How might devs do some of the things we've talked about?

Be aware of the differences and similarities when looking for jobs.

- Responsibilities will give you a better idea of what you'll be doing.
- "Engineering" usually imples an engineering degree is required.

## Ethical Considerations

[ACM Code of Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/)

<p class="demo">Activity: Breakout discussions</p>

1. Examine the following rationale for the ACM Code of Ethics and discuss the following questions:

> Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm, or to influence others to do good or cause harm. To ensure, as much as possible, that their efforts will be used for good, software engineers must commit themselves to making software engineering a beneficial and respected profession.

2. Divide the eight principles of the ACM Code of Ethics among your groups and search for case studies and applications.

### Dillemas

#### Case 1: The Abusive Boss

Your boss is mildly abusive to you and your coworkers.

- Considerations:
  - How abusive?
  - Nature of abuse?
  - Where do they fall in the hierarchy?
- Options (will these work?):
  - Talk to them
  - Report it to HR
  - Report it to their supervisor
  - Bail. Life is short.

#### Case 2: The Negligent Coworker

You know that your coworker didn't properly test a bug fix or piece of functionality, but pushed it through to the final product anyway. Do you report it?

- Considerations:
  - How critical is the bug?
  - Is it violating any laws?
- Options:
  - Report it to your boss
  - Fix it yourself
  - Ignore it

#### Case 3: The Unethical Project

You are asked to work on a project, and later find that it is being used to dox (reveal) anonymous online identities based on voice recognition and patterns of language. What do you do?

- Considerations:
  - Who is your employer? Private company, e.g. news outlet? Government agency?
  - Is it legal (it is case by case in US - legal if "of public interest")?

### Issues

- Confidentiality
  - Engineers should respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.
- Competence
  - Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is outwith their competence.
- Intellectual Property
  - Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents, copyright, etc.
- Computer Misuse
  - Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse other people’s computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (playing games on an employer’s machine) to extremely serious (dissemination of viruses).
