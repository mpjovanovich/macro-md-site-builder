# Categorization Analysis

## Discussion

In the following will look at categorical and hybrid quantitative / categorical tools that may be used in the decision making process for requirements.

### Part 1:

Review the following categorization based methods of prioritizing requirements. Analyze:

- What is the purpose?
- What are its strengths and limitations?

### Part 2:

Find release notes for any software product.

- Apply your chosen methodology to several items from the release.
- Imagine some items that could have been released, but didn't make the cut. Place these into categories.
- Visually present your findings and/or reference the release notes where possible.
