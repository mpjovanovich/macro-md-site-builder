## Assignment Description

In this assignment you will watch a recorded seminar on a topic related to software technologies. You will then refine your understanding of the seminar content by summarizing the most important points in a one page briefing, concise bullet points, and a single sentence summary.

Topics may be advanced for a novice developer, but do your best to try to pick something accessible and interesting to you. The idea is to expose you to new ideas and resources in the field of software development.

## Instructions

### Seminar

Watch a recorded seminar on a topic related to software technologies. This seminar should be at least 20 minutes in length.

A seminar is a presentation or lecture on a specific topic, given by an expert or group of experts in the field and directed at a live audience. This is different from a tutorial or a workshop, which are more guided and interactive. The seminar you pick should not be a personal presentation from an individual (e.g. an individual YouTube educator).

You may find seminars on corporate websites or YouTube. It's often easiest to find a major conference or event and look for recordings of the keynote speech or breakout presentations. Here are some examples:

- [Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io/)
- [Microsoft Build](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/)
- [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
- [Oracle Events](https://developer.oracle.com/events/on-demand-replays.html)

Feel free to explore on your own.

### Write-up

Compose a document containing the following:

- Title and date of the event.

- Link that you used to access the event. Some events require email registration - if this is the case please provide the link to the original registration page.

- One page summary of the most important points of the seminar in your own words. Do not copy and paste from the seminar slides or other sources, and do not use direct quotes.

- 3-5 bullet points summarizing key points of the seminar.

- One sentence summary of the seminar content. How would condense the "big picture" idea of the seminar into a single sentence?

Please provide headings to separate the different sections of your document, as well as your name and the date.
