## Assignment Description

There are many effective ways to organize and track requirements. In this assignment we will use the _GitHub Project_ software tool to create a product backlog and a sprint backlog. This will allow us to track manage requirements and track the progress of our project in a way that is consistent with Agile development practices.

We will refer to your **repository** as the repo for your product, and the **project** as the GitHub project board.

It may be helpful to view the following video before attempting the assignment. The interface has changed slightly since the video was made:

## Instructions

### A. Create GitHub Project

1. From your product repository, navigate to the projects tab and create a GitHub project.
   1. Title your project appropriately.
   1. Use the "table" template.
   1. Make sure that your new project is set to public visibility. This can be changed in the project settings.

_Reference:_

- [Adding your project to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/adding-your-project-to-a-repository)

### B. Configure Home Tab

1. Rename the starting tab on the table to "Home"
1. Create a new label for "user story". You will have to do this from your repository page, not the project board.
1. Show the "Labels" column on the home tab of your project (click the + button on the header row).
1. Create a new column for the "Home" view of the project (click the + button on the header row).
   1. Name this column "Priority".
   1. Set the field type to "Single select".
   1. Add options for "Critical", "High", "Medium", and "Low".
   1. Set a color scheme for the new options (click the context menu for the column and selecting "Edit values...).
1. Create a new column for the "Home" view of the project (click the + button on the header row).
   1. Name this column "Level of Effort".
   1. Set the field type to "Single select".
   1. Add options for "High", "Medium", and "Low".
   1. Set a color scheme for the new options (click the context menu for the column and selecting "Edit values...).

### C. Add User Stories

1. Create at least five issues for your user stories. These will form our initial product backlog.
   1. Type # in a new row and select your repository prior to creating the issue. This links the issue to your repository.
   2. The title of the issue should be brief but descriptive.
   3. In the details pane of the issue, flush out the details of the scenario using the format provided in the example project:
      1. Assumptions / Preconditions - what is assumed to be true before the scenario begins?
      2. Outcomes / Postconditions - what is expected to be true after the scenario ends?
      3. Normal Scenario - what happens in the scenario?
      4. Error Conditions - under what conditions would the scenario fail?
   4. Tag the issues with the label “user story”.
   5. Assign a priority to the issue. Make at least one high, one medium, and one low priority item.
   6. Assign an estimated level of effort to the issue.
   7. Assign the issue to a developer.

### D. Create Sprint Tab

1. Create a new view for your project (a new tab from under the project top level page).
1. Title the view “Sprint [current date]”, subbing in the current date.
1. Using the dropdown arrow, change the layout to “Board”.
1. Create or edit the columns so that you have one for each of the following:
   1. Backlog
   1. In Development
   1. Ready to Test
   1. Done
1. Place some of your user stories in the "Backlog" column, and somne in the "In Development" column.

## Deliverable

N/A. Your instructor should be a collaborator on your GitHub organization and will be able to view your project board.
