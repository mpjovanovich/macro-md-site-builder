## Assignment Description

For this assignment you must have a working version of your software that meets your requirements for iteration 1. You will also post release notes to your organization's website.

### Deployment

**Create a GitHub Release Package**

- Create a .gitattributes file in the root of your repository. We will use this to exclude files from our deployment package
  - Ignore all files that are not necessary for the project to run - e.g. any documentation files that weâ€™ve created through the course, or any intermediate compilation or configuration files in your repository.
  - Use the export-ignore attribute to exclude these files from the deployment package.
- Create a new release in your repository
  - Create a tag for v1.0.0
  - Set the title to v1.0.0

**Take the Product Live**

- Deploy your software.
  - If your software is a binary executable, link to your package from your organization website.
  - If your software is a website, link to your website from your organization website.

### Release Notes

Create release notes for your initial release. The goal of initial release notes is to intoduce the product, highlight notable features, and build anticipation for future development. It is mostly a marketing document, so it should be written in a way that is accessible to a non-technical audience.

Later release notes will be more technical and will include information about bug fixes, known issues, and other technical details.

Some things to consider including:

- Product intro
- Feature highlights
- Hardware or software requirements (if applicable)
- Configuration or setup steps (if applicable)
- Product roadmap or future feature list
- Known issues (if any)
- Way to provide feedback for enhancement requests or bug reports (e.g. support email, issue tracker, etc). This can be faked for this assignment.

Post the release notes to your organization's website as a web page or linked PDF.

## Deliverable
