## Assignment Description

Now that you've reached a new sprint, it's time to update your project board. In this assignment, you will add user stories to your project board and create a sprint board to track the progress of your project.

## Instructions

### A. Add "Sprint" field

- Add a dropdown field for "Sprint" to your project.
- Add an option for "Sprint 1" and "Sprint 2".
- Retroactive requirement: Since we didn't have this field for first iteration, go back and assign any completed issues from Sprint 1 to "Sprint 1".
- Update any issues that were not completed to be tracked under Sprint 2.
- Move this field to follow the "Title" field, as shown in the example project.

### B. Create and Filter Sprint Tabs

1. Create a new view for Sprint 2 titled "Sprint 2". You may copy your "Sprint 1" view.
1. For the Sprint 1 view, filter the issues to only show those assigned to "Sprint 1".
1. For the Sprint 2 view, filter the issues to only show those assigned to "Sprint 2".

### C. Add User Stories

1. Create at least five new issues for your user stories. These will form the backlog for Sprint 2.
   1. Type # in a new row and select your repository prior to creating the issue. This links the issue to your repository.
   2. The title of the issue should be brief but descriptive.
   3. In the details pane of the issue, flush out the details of the scenario using the format provided in the example project:
      1. Assumptions / Preconditions - what is assumed to be true before the scenario begins?
      2. Outcomes / Postconditions - what is expected to be true after the scenario ends?
      3. Normal Scenario - what happens in the scenario?
      4. Error Conditions - under what conditions would the scenario fail?
   4. Tag the issues with the label “user story”.
   5. Assign a priority to the issue. Make at least one high, one medium, and one low priority item.
   6. Assign an estimated level of effort to the issue.
   7. Assign the issue to a developer.
1. Create a new issue for a bug that was discovered in the previous sprint. This will be tracked under Sprint 2. You can make up a scenario if you don't have any current bugs.
   1. Tag the issue with the label “bug”.
   2. Assign a priority to the issue.
   3. Assign an estimated level of effort to the issue.
   4. Assign the issue to a developer.
