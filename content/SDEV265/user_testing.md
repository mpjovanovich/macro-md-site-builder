# User Testing

- Done after release testing.
- Can see how users will actually use the software.
- Often turns up usability issues.
- May result in new requirements.

## Alpha Testing

- Users and devs / designers work together in early release stages.
  - Client project team (the ones giving the requirements)
  - "Power users"
  - Stakeholders with vested interest
- Focus on verifying requirements.

## Beta Testing

- Larger pool of users than alpha testing.
- May be open to public, limited public, early adopters.
- Focus on defect detection and general sentiment.

## Acceptance Testing

- Done by client.
- Client uses own data.
  - May be done in a "sandbox" environment.
  - Full copy or limited copy of production environment.
- Client may sign off on the software, or negotiate changes.
  - Usually conditional acceptance (agree to patch bugs in timeframe, etc.)
