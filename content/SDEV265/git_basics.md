# Git

Git is a powerful tool that you'll almost certainly come across in your career.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a program that runs on a computer. It needs to be installed like any other program:

- [Git (installation and documentation)](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a **version control system (VCS)**:

- Stores files and their history
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Allow for point in time recovery and comparison
- Allows more than one person to work on (or examine) the same file at the same time.

## GitHub

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories.

GitHub is not the same as Git.

## Git Repositories

A **repository** is a collection of files and their history.

- Should be one repository per project.

- Roughly equivalent to a folder on your computer.

- A user can have many repositories:

Files can be uploaded to the repository via drag and drop, or the upload button:

## How to Interface with Git

### The Browser

- Recommended for beginners

### VS Code Source Control Panel

The GUI for Git can be accessed in the VS Code Source Control Panel:

- The number in the circle indicates the number of files that have been changed.
- A commit message is required before you press the button.

After committing, you can push to GitHub with the Sync button:

### Terminals and Shells

Git commands are in the form `git [your_command_here] --[optional_flags_here]`.

Git commands are typed into a **terminal** which runs a **shell**.

- A **terminal** provides a user interface into a shell.

  - This is what you type commands into.
  - Like the part of the car that you see and interact with.

- A **shell** is a program that executes text **commands**.

  - This is what actually runs the command.
  - Like the "engine" of a car.
  - Usually use `bash` or `zsh` shells.

The CLI for Git can be accessed in a VS Code terminal:

- `Ctrl + ~` or `View > Terminal`.

Make sure that you are in the root directory of your project:

- Use the `pwd` command to see the current directory.

Make sure that you have the correct shell selected, _bash_ or _zsh_:
