# Node.js Technologies

## Node.js

JavaScript was originally developed to run in a browser.

**Node.js** is...

- A cross platform **runtime environment**.
- Built on the V8 JavaScript engine (same one that is in Chromium browsers).
- Open-source

### Typical Uses

- Back end or front end web development
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) - service endpoints
- Real-time services (chat, games)
- Streaming services
- Command line tools
- Internet of Things (IoT)

### Subcomponents

- **nvm** - Node Version Manager
  - Manage multiple versions of Node.js
- **npm** - Node Package Manager
  - Install and manage **packages**
- **npx** - Node Package Runner
  - Run packages and execute scripts

## Packages

A **package** is a bundled collection of code. Not specific to Node. Also called...

- **modules**
- **libraries**

## Expo

**Expo** is a package that simplifies certain aspects of React Native development.

We will use Expo to create and run our React Native applications.

## Android Studio

**Android Studio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.

Can create a **virtual device** to run your app.

- Similar to virtual machine.
- Runs actual Android OS.
- More realistic than web-based simulators.

Mac offers an iOS simulator, but only on Mac.
