## Core Components

[Core Components and Native Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components)

A component is a reusable piece of code that describes a part of a user interface - much like HTML elements.

**Core Components** form the fundamental building blocks of a React Native application.

These pieces are translated into native components for each platform.
